 # Historical Developments of AI Planning and Search

## STRIPS

STRIPS is the world's first mainstream planning system. STRIPS uses a new language to describe planning problems.The language used by STRIPS is more influential than its algorithm, and the Classical Language and STRIPS are the closest to each other.

## PDDL

ALD relaxed some of the limitations of the STRIPS language, which was introduced as a computer-readable, standardized syntax to represent planning issues. Since 1998, it has been used as a standard language in international planning competitions.Now, the new version of PDDL is still used by many AI practitioners.

## GRAPHPLAN

The GRAPHPLAN system revived the field of system planning. GRAPHPLAN uses plan guides to guide the search for answers, orders of magnitude faster than the then partial order planner. GRAPHPLAN can receive questions defined in the STRIPS language and then return to a series of operations leading to the target state.The recently developed binary decision diagrams is also based on this idea.
